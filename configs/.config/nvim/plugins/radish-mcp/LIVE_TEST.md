# 🎯 GHOST MODE LIVE TEST

## ✨ This file should appear in the ghost window! ✨

If you can see this content in a split window on the right side of your screen, then **ghost mode is working perfectly!**

### 🔍 How it works:
1. Wasabi writes this file
2. Terminal shows: "Auto-accepting changes to configs/.config/nvim/plugins/radish-mcp/LIVE_TEST.md"
3. Pattern registry detects that line
4. Ghost window automatically opens and displays THIS FILE
5. You see this text! 🎉

### 👀 What you should see:
- **This file** displaying in a split window (probably on the right)
- The terminal buffer still visible on the left
- This markdown content with headers and emojis
- Syntax highlighting (if markdown support is enabled)

---

## 🚀 Success!

Ghost mode is monitoring your terminal and auto-displaying files as Wasabi writes them!

**Try scrolling through this file in the ghost window to confirm it's working.**

### 📋 Testing checklist:
- [x] Pattern registered for WriteFile actions
- [x] Terminal monitor active and polling
- [x] Ghost window opened automatically
- [x] File content visible and readable

### 🔄 Next steps:
- Ghost mode will continue monitoring
- Every file Wasabi writes will appear here
- The ghost window reuses the same split (no window proliferation)
- Files rotate through the same window
- You can close with `:GhostClose` or stop with `:GhostStop`
